## Research Experience
- [**Autonomous Underwater Robotics Development**](https://www.lehighur.org/), Lehigh University | 07/2021 – 09/2022  
    *Software and Business Team Member*
    - **MAVLink and Ardusub Integration**: Continuing to use MAVLink for Pixhawk 4 communication and drone control. Leveraging Ardusub, a microcontroller with automatic drone stabilization, and Pymavlink library to translate movement commands to thruster output.
    - **SLAM Implementation**: Enhancing drone capabilities by integrating Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology, using a comprehensive SLAM algorithm that combines data from stereo cameras, IMUs, and sonar to boost accuracy.
    - **YOLO v8 Adoption**: Upgrading object detection capabilities by moving from YOLO v3 to YOLO v8, significantly simplifying the training process and improving model precision.
    - **Documentation Improvement**: Addressing challenges in onboarding new team members due to inadequate documentation by using Gitbook to record and share information on scripts, code, and design.
    - **System Upgrade**: Transitioning from Jetson Xavier NX to Jetson AGX Orin architecture on Ubuntu 20 with ROS2 Foxy, enhancing performance and responsiveness, and facilitating the use of advanced machine learning models.


- **Smart Drifter for Real-Time In-Water Data Collection**, Lehigh University | 01/2022 – 05/2022
    *Research Assistant*

    - **Hardware Design:** Engineered a compact and robust hardware setup that integrates a Raspberry Pi, Cellular IoT shield, and various sensors to enable effective in-water data collection.
    - **Data Transmission Solution:** Proposed and implemented a solution to send real-time sensor and GPS data to the cloud via LTE, facilitating quick and reliable data access for further analysis.

- **Underwater Acoustic Signal Processing**, Lehigh University | 01/2022 - 08/2022
    *Research Assistant*
    - **Study on Detection Algorithms:** Explored the effects of the PRI filter on three distinct Tag-ID detection algorithms: time-domain, frequency-domain, and hybrid approach.
    - **Development of Evaluation Metrics:** Devised metrics such as Probability of Detection (Pd) and False Alarm Rate (Fa) for a more precise evaluation. Employed ROC curves for performance visualization.
    - **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Processed and analyzed 21,000 field data files to assess the efficiency of the chosen algorithms.
    - **Algorithm Performance Result:** Found that the frequency-domain detection algorithm outperformed others with a detection rate of 87% at a false alarm rate of 5%, and had the lowest time complexity (O(n log n)).
    - **Real-world Application:** Utilized the findings to enhance the field of Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). This resulted in better understanding of underwater animal behavior and survival rates, potentially improving data reliability by 15%.

- **Autonomous Driving and Robotic Racing**, Lehigh University | 01/2022 – 06/2022
    *Team Leader*
    - **Pure Pursuit Algorithm Modification:** Led the team in developing and fine-tuning a custom version of the pure pursuit algorithm, enabling more efficient autonomous racing capabilities.
    - **Optimized Algorithm Parameters:** Successfully optimized the algorithm parameters to improve the speed and accuracy of the autonomous vehicle.
    - **Waypoint Editing Tool:** Designed and implemented a MATLAB-based tool to add and edit waypoints on a map, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the autonomous vehicle's route planning.
