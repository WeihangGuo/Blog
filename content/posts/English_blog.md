As a Chinese student studying abroad in the US, I was surprised to learn about the differences between Chinese and Western depictions of dragons. While reading the Hobbit, I was shocked to find that it was depicted as a vicious and dangerous creature. This was in stark contrast to the revered Chinese dragons I had grown up learning about, which were symbols of power, strength, and good luck. As I continued reading, I realized that the physical appearance and cultural significance of Chinese and Western dragons were vastly different.

Chinese dragons were typically depicted as long and serpentine, with bright colors and intricate patterns, and associated with good fortune and prosperity. Meanwhile, Western dragons were often portrayed as large, scaly beasts with wings and fiery breath and were often viewed as villains to be defeated. This realization was shocking to me, as I had never considered the possibility of such a stark difference between two creatures that shared the same name. It emphasized the importance of cultural understanding and appreciation and the potential misunderstandings that can arise when different cultures have different interpretations of symbols and images. **While both interpretations have their own unique merits, the dragon in Chinese culture is superior to the dragon in Western culture due to their more profound cultural significance, symbolism, and positive connotations (Need Change)**. 

## Origins and Historical Context

**Chinese Dragon**

The history of the Chinese dragon dates back thousands of years, with early depictions found in artifacts such as pottery, bronze ware, and jade carvings from the Neolithic period and various Chinese dynasties. The dragon's significance in Chinese culture is deeply rooted in ancient beliefs and religions, including Taoism and Confucianism. It was considered a divine creature, symbolizing power, wisdom, and authority, and was often associated with the emperor and celestial forces. Over time, the Chinese dragon myth evolved and absorbed elements from various Chinese myths, legends, and cultural beliefs, coming to represent aspects of Chinese culture such as water, agriculture, and imperial power.

This image is a portrait of an ancient emperor in Chinese. The symbol of dragon is everywhere from the clothes to the chair. 

**Western Dragon**

The concept of the Western dragon can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia, where creatures like the Sumerian dragon and the Akkadian Mushussu were depicted. These early dragon-like beings influenced the myths and legends of Greece and Rome, where they took on more recognizable forms, such as the Hydra and the Chimera. The dragon myth in the West was further shaped by the spread of Christianity and European folklore, which imbued the dragon with a more sinister connotation. As a result, Western dragons became symbols of evil, fear, and malevolence, often appearing as formidable adversaries in stories and legends.
